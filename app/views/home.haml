    Hello, world!
    =============

    This is a [Monk](http://monkrb.com) skeleton that uses MongoDB as the database and [HAML/SASS](http://haml-lang.com/) for the views. This skeleton lives at [http://github.com/monkrb/skeleton](http://github.com/bummer/yasumi).

    The page you are looking at was generated by `app/routes/site.rb`, and the template is located at `app/views/home.haml`.

    Settings
    --------

    Check the configuration file at `config/settings.yml`. The keys under each environment can be accessed with the global `monk_settings` function, and you will also find an example in the default route.


    Testing
    -------

    There's user story written for you at `test/stories/site_test.rb`. Start adding...

    Dependencies
    ------------

    Run `dep list` to see the list of dependencies, `dep list test` to check the dependencies for the test environment. Feel free to edit the `dependencies` file in the root of this project. More info about the `dep` command can be found [here](http://github.com/djanowski/dependencies).
